Second, we'll cover the basics of using Python's standard data science libraries.  Third, we'll actually do some things with real data to see what kinds of analyses are possible.\n",

    "Okay, now that we've picked a file, what is inside of it? For that we'll use another shell command called `head`.  `head` gives the first few lines of a file, ten by default, but you can change that with the `-n` flag.  It's counterpart is `tail`, which returns the *last* ten lines of a file.  Head is useful for looking at the tops of data files, where by convention the definition of the data is stored.  Tail is useful for looking at things like log files, where you are interested in seeing whether something is finished, what happened to cause a program to crash, and so on.  So let's call `head` on the path variable.  We can do that by using a \"dollar sign interpolation\" on the python variable `path`.  The dollar sign says to the command parser \"don't actually use the word path.  Instead use the contents of the variable named `path`."

    "Third, we can see that this file is reasonably well formatted (well, at least the first 5 lines look good).  CSV is a super common file format, but there are lots of tricky edge cases, and in a surprisingly high number of cases of data floating around in the wild, you'll find really ugly things like quotation marks that open but don't close, floating commas at the end of each line, and so on.  Here we see that the first column and last column both have open and close quotes; that each line ends *without* a dangling comma; that the header row has four items, and each data row has for items; and that the first column looks like a timestamp.  \n",
    "\n",

    "Okay, that worked just fine.  It is sometimes the case that the input times that look like times to a human are confusing to a computer.  For example, the above data is in \"year-month-day\" format.  Americans often put time in \"month day year\" format, while the European standard is to use a \"day month year\" format.  It's all terribly confusing to a poor program, so you can specify what you *mean* by using a `format` parameter that describes exactly what is where.  Details are given on [the `to_datetime` documentation page](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#converting-to-timestamps).\n",
    "\n",
    "But actually, the read_csv function has lots of options, and one of them is to read in the data as a timestamp in the first place.  So we'll change our `data = pd.read_csv(path)` line from above to use these options.  This takes a bit more time that the earlier `read_csv` command, because now it has to actually process and interpret each of those 600,000 timestamps and turn them into a `datetime64` structure."
